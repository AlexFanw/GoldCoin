The defendant, Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company, raised valid concerns regarding the privacy of non-party information and the need to comply with regulations like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and HIPAA. The defendant proposed the production of data compilations instead of individual PIP files to minimize the disclosure of sensitive PHI.
