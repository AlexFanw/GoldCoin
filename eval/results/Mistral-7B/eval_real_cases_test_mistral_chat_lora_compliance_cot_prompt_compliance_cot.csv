In this case, the city's decision not to disclose certain information, such as individual claims experiences and identities of covered dependents, falls within the permitted grounds for denying access under the HIPAA regulation."

The dispute highlights the balance between transparency and privacy rights. However, according to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a covered entity like OHSU cannot disclose protected health information, including the names of claimants and dates of torts, unless it is necessary for a judicial or administrative proceeding or where the disclosure is required by law.
