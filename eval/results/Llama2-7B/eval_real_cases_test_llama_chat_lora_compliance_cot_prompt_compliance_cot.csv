Step 3: HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the case.   The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows covered entities, such as health plans and health care providers, to disclose protected health information (PHI) to the extent necessary for judicial proceedings. In this case, the states, as covered entities, are seeking legal permission to share the de-identified medical records of Medicaid patients. Although the states are not health care providers or plans, they can rely on 45 CFR 164.512(e)(1) to disclose the information. 45 CFR 164.512(e)(1) permits a covered entity to disclose PHI in response to a court order, subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process, as long as the conditions specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of the regulation are met. Specifically, the disclosure must be required by law, appropriate for the legal proceeding, and limited to the relevant documents or information in the custody of the covered entity.     The request from Lilly for access to the Medicaid patients' medical records meets the requirements of 45 CFR 164.512(e)(1)(ii). It is required by law since it is part of a judicial proceeding related to the pharmaceutical company's legal defense. The request is appropriate because the information is directly relevant to the legal matter, and the disclosure will help establish the facts of the case. Finally, the disclosure is limited to the specific records and information needed for the legal proceedings, minimizing any potential breach of privacy.    The states may use this exception under HIPAA to share the de-identified medical records without violating patients' privacy rights. By removing all identifying features and ensuring the data cannot be linked to an individual, the states can legally provide the required information while respecting patient privacy.    Therefore, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the flow of private health information in this case."

Step 3: HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the case.
The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows a covered entity to disclose protected health information for a law enforcement purpose without obtaining written authorization from the individual or their opportunity to agree or object, as long as certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is that the disclosure is to a law enforcement official, such as the DEA, for a law enforcement purpose, as stated in 164.512(f).In this case, the DEA issued a subpoena seeking comprehensive medical information related to Dr. Zadeh's patients, including diagnoses, prescriptions, laboratory results, and payment methods. While Dr. Zadeh was concerned about the potential violation of state and federal privacy regulations, the DEA's request included a nondisclosure provision instructing him not to notify the affected patients about the subpoena or the ongoing investigation for one year.The HIPAA Privacy Rule does not forbid the case. Although Dr. Zadeh was notified of the subpoena without his knowledge or involvement, there is no evidence to suggest he agreed to or consented to the disclosure of his patients' protected health information. Moreover, the DEA's request did not seek permission from any of the affected patients. Therefore, the disclosure meets the condition set forth in 164.512(f)(2)(i), which states that the covered entity may disclose protected health information for a law enforcement purpose to a law enforcement official if the covered entity has determined that the disclosure is necessary to respond to a legitimate request from the law enforcement official."

Specifically, the Rule permits covered entities to disclose protected health information in response to a subpoena or similar process, provided the covered entity receives satisfactory assurances deemed sufficient by the Secretary that the information will be kept confidential and only used for the purpose of the proceeding (164.512(b)(7)(i)). In this case, the non-party entities receiving subpoenas are seeking John Kris Morris's medical records, employment records, unemployment compensation records, and Social Security application for the purpose of defending against his discrimination claim, which aligns with the conditions stated in the Rule."

The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows for the disclosure of protected health information in the course of legal proceedings, such as judicial or administrative hearings, through a valid authorization form. In this case, Sherri Smith, as the legal guardian and next friend of Carli Smith, has legally signed a modified authorization form, limiting the disclosure of private communications with healthcare providers to the extent necessary to comply with the lawsuit. This authorization meets the conditions specified in 164.502(d)(1)(ii)(B) of the Privacy Rule, as the type of information shared is limited to medical records and bills, while excluding any private interviews with healthcare providers. Therefore, the HIPAA Privacy Rule does not forbid the case."

The nursing facilities' decision to deny the requests for access to the deceased residents' medical records can be seen as a reasonable interpretation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Under 164.502(b), covered entities may disclose protected health information for purposes of facilitating the proper administration of government benefits programs, including social security programs. The nursing facilities believed that providing the requested medical records would enable the payment of benefits to the deceased residents' eligible survivors, in accordance with state law, as they were legally authorized representatives. This interpretation is in line with the rule's provision, allowing for the disclosure of protected health information when necessary for the proper administration of government benefits programs. Therefore, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the nursing facilities' action in this case."
