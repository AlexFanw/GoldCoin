As a result, Cohan's health information cannot be shared without his explicit written agreement to do so, as required by the Privacy Rule. In this instance, Cohan refused to sign the authorization due to concerns about the possible broad use and re-disclosure of his health information, which could potentially violate his rights under the Privacy Rule and the Hawai'i Constitution. To address these concerns, Cohan suggested entering into a stipulated qualified protective order (SQPO), which would limit the use and disclosure of his health information strictly to the underlying litigation.

As a Nurse Practitioner, Linda Cardamone, acted based on her belief that Mr. Bayne could pose a risk to himself. She contacted Defendants Provost and Meehan, New York State Troopers, to help protect her patient's best interests. However, they took Mr. Bayne to Saratoga Hospital without conducting a thorough investigation or mental health evaluation. These actions resulted in Mr. Bayne being falsely imprisoned, and he sued the defendants under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 and for false imprisonment. In this situation, it is appropriate to seek access to Mr. Bayne's medical records to build a defense. However, Mr. Bayne granted a limited medical authorization, which did not include discussing his medical condition, course of treatment, or prognosis.

The case involves a request for a medical release to access Harrold-Jones's complete medical records and conduct ex parte contact with her treating physicians without her or her lawyer's presence. Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, this kind of request for a medical release to share protected health information (PHI) from a covered entity like Denali without the patient's authorization is not permitted. Also, it is essential to note that under the regulation, patients have the right to decide who receives their PHI, including medical providers, insurance companies, and other parties involved in their medical care. As such, the request for a medical release to facilitate ex parte communication between Harrold-Jones's treating physicians and Denali's legal team would violate the patient's privacy rights and the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Therefore, it is necessary to deny the request for a medical release and avoid any ex parte communication that could compromise Harrold-Jones's confidentiality and privacy rights."
['164.512(f)(1)(ii)(B)'],Permit,"HIPAA Privacy Rule does not permit the case as it violates the patient's right to privacy. As per the case, the hospital received a subpoena to disclose the patient's medical records, including the blood-alcohol test results. Although the state claimed the information was necessary for a legal purpose, it failed to obtain the patient's consent before accessing his medical data. Therefore, the disclosure of the patient's medical information without his consent violates his privacy rights under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In this situation, the legal instrument provided to obtain the patient's medical records did not supersede the patient's right to privacy under the HIPAA Privacy Rule."
