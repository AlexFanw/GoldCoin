In this case, Lesha Carter, the patient, seeks to inform her healthcare provider of her intention to file a claim against them and provide access to her and her child's medical records to support the claim. However, the authorization forms sent by Lesha do not meet the specific requirements under regulation 164.508, specifically regarding the description of the information to be disclosed, the individuals or entities authorized to make the disclosure, and the purpose of the disclosure. Additionally, there is ambiguity regarding Lesha's authority to act on behalf of Jazyhia, her minor child. Therefore, the healthcare provider cannot lawfully access the necessary medical information due to the non-compliant authorization form. Although Lesha had the belief and intent to grant access to her and her child's medical records, the failure to follow the specific requirements of the Privacy Rule prevents the healthcare provider from accessing the information. In this case, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the healthcare provider to refrain from accessing the medical records due to the non-compliant authorization form."

In this case, the 911 dispatch service can share protected health information with the caller seeking emergency assistance without obtaining explicit consent.

In this situation, the flow of private information involves a law enforcement officer, Trooper Saleem Abdullah, seeking access to a patient's protected health information (PHI) to aid in an investigation. Specifically, Abdullah requests a blood sample from the patient, Vernon Peltz, to determine his blood alcohol content (BAC) in relation to a car accident. Here, the HIPAA Privacy Rule allows the disclosure of PHI without explicit patient consent under  164.512(f). This provision allows for the use or disclosure of protected health information for specialized government functions, such as law enforcement activities. In this case, the covered entity, the nurse responsible for drawing and storing Peltz's blood sample, can provide the necessary information to Abdullah for the stated purpose of determining Peltz's BAC levels, provided that the covered entity receives satisfactory assurances from the appropriate government authority that the PHI will only be used or disclosed for the stated purpose."

The non-party law firms, serving as legal representatives for their clients, raised concerns about the scope and burden of the requests, citing various privileges and the potential violation of state and federal medical privacy laws. While State Farm argues that the law firms failed to specify their objections and establish applicable privileges, the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that covered entities, like non-party law firms, obtain explicit authorization from individuals before disclosing their protected health information in judicial or administrative proceedings.

In this case, the creditor, Colonial Orthopaedics, submitted the Proof of Claim to the court without obtaining the consent of the debtors, Maple and his wife. Furthermore, the information shared included sensitive items such as social security numbers, dates of birth, home and work phone numbers, medical information, and insurance identifiers. While the court granted the Maples' motion to restrict public access to the Proof of Claim, the fact that the information was initially publicly available through PACER raises concerns about the adequacy of existing protections for individuals whose personal information is inadvertently exposed in legal proceedings. Therefore, this case is not in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule."

In this instance, the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation is allowed to provide the requested statistical data about allegations of abuse, but they are prohibited from disclosing specific information that could identify the individuals involved, such as the names of the facilities where the incidents occurred. This is because doing so would violate the Privacy Rule's provisions regarding the protection of individually identifiable health information, specifically , which states that a covered entity may not use or disclose protected health information unless, among other things, the individual who is the subject of the information has provided written authorization for the use or disclosure. In this case, since no such authorization exists, the Department must ensure that any disclosed information is de-identified to prevent potential identification of the individuals involved. By omitting the facility names from the report, the Department seeks to balance the public's right to information with the need to safeguard the privacy of those affected."
