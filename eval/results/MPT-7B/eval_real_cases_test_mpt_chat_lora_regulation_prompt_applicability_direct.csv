[],Not Applicable,"Based on the information provided, it appears that there could be potential applicability of the HIPAA Privacy Rule depending on how the protected health information (PHI) related to medical conditions being discussed were handled during these restrictions. It seems like some PHI might've been involved here since one of the reasons given for initial restrictorion was ""photo[es] that do not meet [DOC Policy 450.100]"" requirement.

The rule applies when protected health information (PHI) is shared between covered entities or business associates. In the scenario presented here, the Department of Homeland Security appears to have been both a covered entity and a business associate relative to the individual being examined for fitness-for-duty. It would depend upon how the PHI exchanged among them falls within one of several categories enumerated in the regulations."
